> React Native Elements has UI elements that are easy to use & really customizable. It also has theming, platform specific search bars, [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) support, and much more.

It's finally here! Let's put our hands together and welcome React Native Elements 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

This release is centered around making RNE components that everyone loves more intuitive to use & stable. This is not to say that all the work is done, but this is definitely a giant leap in the right direction and one that we have been working on for over a year.

I want like to say thank you to our users for using RNE and giving us feedback through issues on the repo and also the contributors who have the taken time to contribute and help improve RNE together. Finally, I'd like to say a big thanks to [Kyle Roach](https://twitter.com/roach_iam) and [Xavier VillelÃ©gier](https://twitter.com/xaviervllgr) without whom this project would not have been as awesome as it is today!!

This blog post is meant to serve as a migration guide for upgrading to `react-native-elements: "^1.0.0"` and also a way to document and share all the breaking changes, new features and other improvements in this release.

The wait is over!! Get excited, cause we certainly are. 14K ðŸŒŸ and counting...
