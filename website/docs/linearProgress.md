Progress indicators inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. They communicate an appâ€™s state and indicate available actions, such as whether users can navigate away from the current screen.

## Usage

```js
import { LinearProgress } from 'react-native-elements';
```

```js
<LinearProgress color="primary" />
```
